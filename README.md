# ship-generator
Procedural space ship model generator. It's just draft for now with a lot of random content.

## Inspirations
### Daisy Bell by IBM 7094 in 1961
### Live long and prosper

## TODO:
### Spaceship details like antenas
### Spaceship cockpit
### Spaceship wings type narrow like x-wing from star wars
### Space engine types (instead of one big tail engine, engines can be placed on wings or attached directly to hull)
### Texture with details like hull plates, windows (cockpit especially), pipelines near engine, bumpy boxes and tank parts, bumpy stripes, ladder steps, hull scratches, hull plate
